# Transaction Currency Sync Implementation

## Overview

This implementation ensures that all transactions inherit and maintain the correct currency from their associated bank statement's `accountCurrency`. The system provides both automated syncing and manual tools to fix currency inconsistencies.

## Problem Addressed

1. **Missing Currency Data**: Transactions were being saved without currency information
2. **Inconsistent Currency**: Some transactions had incorrect currency due to previous corrupt scripts
3. **No Cascade Updates**: When bank statement currency was updated, transactions weren't automatically updated

## Solution Components

### 1. TransactionCurrencyService (`src/lib/services/transactionCurrencyService.ts`)

A comprehensive service class that provides:

#### **Force Sync** (`syncTransactionCurrencies()`)
- Updates ALL transactions to match their bank statement's `accountCurrency`
- Overwrites existing currency data (useful for fixing corrupted data)
- Processes transactions in batches of 100 for performance
- Logs overwrites for transparency

#### **Gentle Sync** (`syncMissingTransactionCurrencies()`)
- Only updates transactions that have no currency or empty currency
- Preserves existing currency data
- Safer for routine maintenance

#### **Individual Transaction Sync** (`ensureTransactionCurrency()`)
- Updates a single transaction to match its bank statement currency
- Returns boolean indicating if update was needed

#### **Statement-Level Sync** (`updateTransactionsCurrencyForStatement()`)
- Updates all transactions for a specific bank statement
- Used when bank statement currency is changed

#### **Statistics** (`getCurrencyStatistics()`)
- Provides comprehensive currency coverage statistics
- Shows breakdown by currency type
- Useful for monitoring and debugging

### 2. API Endpoints (`src/app/api/currency/sync-transactions/route.ts`)

#### **GET /api/currency/sync-transactions**
Returns current currency statistics:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Currency statistics retrieved successfully",
  "stats": {
    "totalTransactions": 579,
    "transactionsWithCurrency": 579,
    "transactionsWithoutCurrency": 0,
    "coveragePercentage": 100,
    "currencyBreakdown": [
      {"currency": "EGP", "count": 518},
      {"currency": "USD", "count": 34},
      {"currency": "EUR", "count": 27}
    ]
  }
}
```

#### **POST /api/currency/sync-transactions**
Runs currency sync with options:
```json
{
  "force": true  // true for force sync, false for gentle sync
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Transaction currency sync completed successfully (FORCE mode)",
  "mode": "force",
  "stats": { /* statistics object */ }
}
```

### 3. Bank Statement Update Cascade (`src/app/api/annotation/statements/[id]/route.ts`)

**Automatic Currency Cascading**: When a bank statement's `accountCurrency` is updated, all associated transactions are automatically updated to match.

```typescript
// If accountCurrency was updated, cascade the change to all transactions
if (accountCurrency !== undefined && accountCurrency !== existingStatement.accountCurrency) {
  const updatedTransactions = await tx.transaction.updateMany({
    where: { bankStatementId: id },
    data: { currency: accountCurrency }
  });
  console.log(`🔄 Updated currency for ${updatedTransactions.count} transactions to ${accountCurrency}`);
}
```

### 4. Google Sheets Sync Integration (`src/app/api/annotation/statements/[id]/google-sheet/route.ts`)

**New Transaction Currency Inheritance**: When creating transactions from Google Sheets sync, they automatically inherit the bank statement's currency:

```typescript
const transactionsToCreate = updatedTransactions
  .filter(row => row.date)
  .map(row => ({
    // ... other fields
    currency: statement.accountCurrency || null // Inherit currency from bank statement
  }));
```

### 5. Command Line Script (`scripts/sync-transaction-currencies.js`)

A standalone script for manual currency sync operations:

```bash
npm run sync-currencies
```

**Features:**
- Shows before/after statistics
- Detailed progress reporting
- Logs all currency overwrites
- Safe error handling with Prisma disconnect

**Example Output:**
```
🚀 Starting FORCE Transaction Currency Sync Script...
⚠️  This will update ALL transactions to match their bank statement currency!

📈 Initial Statistics:
   Total Transactions: 579
   With Currency: 579 (100%)
   Without Currency: 0

💰 Currency Breakdown:
   EGP: 579 transactions

🔄 Running FORCE currency sync...
🔄 Overwriting transaction 58 currency from EGP to USD
...

📈 Final Statistics:
   Total Transactions: 579
   With Currency: 579 (100%)
   Without Currency: 0

💰 Final Currency Breakdown:
   EGP: 518 transactions
   USD: 34 transactions
   EUR: 27 transactions
```

## Usage Scenarios

### 1. **Initial Database Fix** (Current situation)
```bash
npm run sync-currencies
```
This runs a force sync to fix any corrupted currency data.

### 2. **API-Based Sync**
```bash
# Force sync all transactions
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/currency/sync-transactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"force": true}'

# Gentle sync (only missing currencies)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/currency/sync-transactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"force": false}'

# Get statistics
curl http://localhost:3000/api/currency/sync-transactions
```

### 3. **Automatic Cascading**
When updating a bank statement's currency through the UI or API, all transactions automatically update.

### 4. **New Transaction Creation**
All new transactions (from imports, Google Sheets sync, etc.) automatically inherit the correct currency.

## Key Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensures all transactions have accurate currency information
2. **Automatic Maintenance**: Currency updates cascade automatically
3. **Corruption Recovery**: Force sync can fix data corrupted by previous scripts
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive statistics for tracking currency coverage
5. **Flexibility**: Both gentle and force sync options for different scenarios
6. **Performance**: Batch processing for large datasets
7. **Transparency**: Detailed logging of all changes

## Technical Architecture

```
Bank Statement (accountCurrency: "USD")
├── Transaction 1 (currency: "USD") ✓
├── Transaction 2 (currency: "USD") ✓
└── Transaction 3 (currency: "USD") ✓

When Bank Statement currency changes to "EUR":
├── Transaction 1 (currency: "EUR") ✓ [Auto-updated]
├── Transaction 2 (currency: "EUR") ✓ [Auto-updated]
└── Transaction 3 (currency: "EUR") ✓ [Auto-updated]
```

## Results

✅ **579 transactions** successfully synced  
✅ **Multi-currency support** with EGP (518), USD (34), EUR (27)  
✅ **100% currency coverage** achieved  
✅ **Automatic cascading** implemented  
✅ **Corruption fixed** from previous scripts  

The system now ensures robust currency management across all transaction data.
