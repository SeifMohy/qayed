# Automatic Validation Implementation

## Overview
The system now automatically validates bank statements and updates their status to "passed" when validation succeeds. This happens in three scenarios:

## 1. Manual Validation (Existing)
**Location**: `/api/annotation/statements/[id]/validate` (POST)
**Trigger**: User clicks "Validate" button in the UI
**Behavior**: 
- Performs balance validation calculation
- Automatically sets status to "passed" if validation succeeds
- Sets status to "failed" if validation fails
- Updates `validated`, `validationStatus`, `validationNotes`, and `validatedAt` fields

## 2. Google Sheets Sync (New)
**Location**: `/api/annotation/statements/[id]/google-sheet` (PUT)
**Trigger**: User syncs changes from Google Sheets
**Behavior**:
- Syncs transaction data from Google Sheets
- Automatically runs validation on the updated data
- Sets status to "passed" if validation succeeds
- Sets status to "failed" if validation fails
- Provides validation feedback in the API response

## 3. Initial Processing (New)
**Location**: `/api/structure-bankstatement` (POST)
**Trigger**: Bank statement is initially processed from PDF
**Behavior**:
- Creates bank statement and transactions from AI processing
- Automatically runs validation on each created statement
- Sets status to "passed" if validation succeeds immediately
- Sets status to "pending" if validation fails (for manual review)
- Does not fail the entire process if validation encounters errors

## Validation Logic

### Balance Calculation
```
Expected Ending Balance = Starting Balance + Total Credits - Total Debits
Discrepancy = |Expected Ending Balance - Actual Ending Balance|
```

### Validation Rules
- **Tolerance**: 0.01 (1 cent) to account for rounding differences
- **Status**: "passed" if discrepancy ≤ tolerance, "failed" otherwise

### Database Updates
When validation **passes**:
- `validated` = `true`
- `validationStatus` = `"passed"`
- `validatedAt` = current timestamp
- `validationNotes` = success message with calculation details

When validation **fails**:
- `validated` = `false`
- `validationStatus` = `"failed"`
- `validatedAt` = `null` (or current timestamp for manual validation)
- `validationNotes` = failure message with discrepancy details

## Validation Messages

### Success Messages
- **Manual**: "Validation passed. Starting balance (X) + Credits (Y) - Debits (Z) = Ending balance (W)"
- **Sync**: "Auto-validation passed after sync. Starting balance (X) + Credits (Y) - Debits (Z) = Ending balance (W)"
- **Initial**: "Auto-validation passed during processing. Starting balance (X) + Credits (Y) - Debits (Z) = Ending balance (W)"

### Failure Messages
- **Manual**: "Validation failed. Expected ending balance: X, Actual: Y, Discrepancy: Z"
- **Sync**: "Auto-validation failed after sync. Expected ending balance: X, Actual: Y, Discrepancy: Z"
- **Initial**: "Auto-validation failed during processing. Expected ending balance: X, Actual: Y, Discrepancy: Z"

## API Response Changes

### Google Sheets Sync Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "transactionCount": 6,
    "message": "Transactions synced successfully from Google Sheets",
    "validationStatus": "passed",
    "validationNotes": "Auto-validation passed after sync..."
  }
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
1. User uploads bank statement → Status: "pending"
2. User manually clicks "Validate" → Status: "passed" or "failed"
3. User edits in Google Sheets → Status: "pending" (manual validation required)

### After
1. User uploads bank statement → Status: "passed" (if balanced) or "pending" (if not)
2. User manually clicks "Validate" → Status: "passed" or "failed" (unchanged)
3. User edits in Google Sheets → Status: "passed" (if balanced) or "failed" (if not)

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Manual Work**: Statements that balance correctly are automatically approved
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Users know validation status immediately after syncing
3. **Consistent Validation**: Same validation logic applied everywhere
4. **Better UX**: Less clicking and waiting for users
5. **Audit Trail**: Clear validation notes explain why status was set

## Error Handling

- **Initial Processing**: Validation errors don't fail the entire upload process
- **Google Sheets Sync**: Validation errors are logged but don't prevent sync
- **Manual Validation**: Validation errors are returned to the user

## Technical Implementation

### Shared Validation Function
The same validation logic is used across all three scenarios:

```typescript
function performValidation(statement: any): {
  status: 'passed' | 'failed';
  notes: string;
} {
  // Calculate totals and discrepancy
  // Apply tolerance rules
  // Generate appropriate notes
  // Return status and notes
}
```

### Database Consistency
All validation updates use the same database field mapping:
- `validated`: boolean indicating if validation passed
- `validationStatus`: "passed", "failed", or "pending"
- `validationNotes`: human-readable explanation
- `validatedAt`: timestamp when validation passed (null if failed)

This ensures consistent behavior and data integrity across the entire application.
