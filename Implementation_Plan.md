# Implementation Plan: Cashflow Management Dashboard

This document outlines the step-by-step approach for implementing the Cashflow Management Dashboard MVP based on the requirements. The implementation is divided into two major phases:

1. **Phase A: Frontend Structure** - Creating a fully functional UI with mock data for showcasing the MVP's potential
2. **Phase B: Backend Integration** - Building the backend structure and connecting it to live user data

## PHASE A: FRONTEND STRUCTURE (Weeks 1-3)

The goal of this phase is to create a complete UI demonstration with working navigation, interactive components, and realistic mock data. This will allow for showcasing the potential of the MVP without backend integration.

### A1: Project Setup and Mock Authentication (Week 1) ✅

#### Initial Project Configuration ✅
- Review and update existing Next.js project structure
- Set up proper TypeScript types for the application
- Configure mock authentication flow with client-side state

#### Landing Page Enhancement ✅
- Update hero section with product tagline and value proposition "Empowering Enterprises with CFO-Level Cashflow Management" 
- Add problem statement and solution overview sections "Gaining clear visibility into cashflow is challenging and time-consuming. Finance teams spend countless hours manually combining data from multiple disconnected sources—banks, ERPs, electronic invoices—leading to:

Reactive financial management.

Cash shortfalls resulting in delayed payments.

Expensive reliance on short-term loans or overdrafts.

Too often, enterprises find themselves constantly reacting rather than proactively planning their financial futures."

- Implement features summary section: We provide an intuitive, easy-to-use dashboard that consolidates your financial data—from banks, ERP systems, and electronic invoices—into one powerful, centralized tool.

Key Features:

Real-Time Visibility: Clearly track your current cash position across all accounts and currencies.

Reliable Forecasting: Accurately predict future cash inflows and outflows to avoid surprises.

Scenario Planning: Easily simulate multiple financial situations to make informed decisions.

Actionable Insights: Identify opportunities to save money, optimize your resources, and strengthen your financial position.

Spend less time gathering data, and more time acting on it.
